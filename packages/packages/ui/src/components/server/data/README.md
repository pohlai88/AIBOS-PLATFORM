# Server Data Components

Components that fetch and display data on the server.

## Purpose

- Improve initial page load performance

## Examples

## Guidelines

- Handle loading states at the layout level
- Use Suspense boundaries for streaming
- Cache data appropriately with Next.js fetch options
